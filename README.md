# Sedov-ML: Machine Learning for Sedov Blast

## Mokbel Karam, Ming Jiang, Fady Najjar

Machine learning for predicting physics variables in Sedov blast simulation.

This library contains pieces of software to run the Sedov blast simulation code, to generate the training data from the simulation, to run the machine learning code from scikit-learn/TensorFlow/Keras library, and to perform evaluation on the prediction results using machine learning models.
